# 🌟 Stellar Stories: Space Weather Through the Eyes of Earthlings

An interactive educational web application that teaches students about space weather phenomena and their impacts on different groups of people on Earth. This project was developed for the **2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge**.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Challenge**: Write and illustrate a digital children's story that explains what space weather is and the varying impacts it has on different people such as farmers, pilots, astronauts, power grid operators, and the general public.

**Solution**: An immersive, multi-modal learning experience that combines interactive storytelling, educational games, and visual content to make space weather concepts accessible and engaging.
